# Pneumonia-X-rays
Image Classification with data from Kaggle dataset.
My first attempt with image classification using CNN, X_rays are taken from Kaggle 
https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
My program has 82% Accuracy with 98% recall rate in pneumonia case, while precission is a bit low with 78% 
The above precission rate produces many false positives cases. The program needs improvent in order to achieve fewer false positives cases, 
while it will retain its power 98% recall rate.
